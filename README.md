# newsletter-email-subscription
This newsletter sign up stores your name and email in Mail Chimp. I changed out the secret in the URL as well as 
the api key, so that they do not match what is in github. However, it is deployed with an .env file for privacy on
my portfolio. The api key in this uploaded project has been disabled for security purposes.
